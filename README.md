# Front-end Architecture

## What is Front-end Architecture?

Front-end Architecture is a field concerned with the principles, guidelines, policies, models, standards, processes, and strategic thinking necessary for the planning, creation, and management of front-end projects. It aims to promote maintainability, code quality, faster time to market, openess for changes in UI/UX, reusability, and longer life of the applications. It starts with the basic concerns of System Design, such as algorithms, technologies' selection, data flow, design patterns, and architectual design, but it goes up, close to the Software Architecture level, by monitoring, coordinating and sychronizing the efforts across the organization.

## Front-end Architecture in practice:

Some of the basic tasks of front-end architects include:

- Create or assist in the creation of the [Software Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design) (blueprins) of new applications

- Balance expectations of multiple stakeholders and find technical solutions that meet that balanced list of quality attributes (trade offs)

- Setup efficient and pleasant dev enviroments

- Set standards and best practices for front-end development teams

- Conduct Proofs of Concept and research of web technologies

- Define realistic and sustainable protocols and processes for documentation and testing

- Find efficient ways to communicate architectural decisions to multiple types of stakeholders

- Study the past, present, and future of web technologies. Monitor the state of web technologies and preformed educated predictions

- Identify preemptively challenges and road blocks that new technologies (or new versions) will bring, and find best solutions for them

- Synchronize technologies, standards, and efforts across multiple teams in the organization

- Provide training and coaching for developers

- Organize the workflow as to maximize productivity (shield developers from unwanted / unecessary meetings, recommend purchase of adequate tools, etc)

- Work with managers to find ways to promote retention of developers (employee retention programs)

- Help to facilitate and otimize deployment processes

- Help non-technical stakeholders to learn all of their technical options, including new technologies

- Help identify and translate business needs and expectations into technical directives, making sure that the technical aspects will continuously support and favor them

- Scaffold new complex applications, setting developers in the right direction

- Coordinate think tanks and brain trusts


## Objective of the repo
This repo is a public place for sharing files, templates, and docs used by front-end architects to plan, document and manage projects. Besides pre-formated blank documents, we can share here mindmaps, flowcharts, cheat sheets, and any other kind of files that can help architects fulfill their role.

Please feel free to collaborate and send pull requests. Our goal is to make this space a robust library of free resources for front-end architects.

## What is Front-end Architecture?

Front-end Architecture is a specialization of Software Architecture. It aims to provide guidance to front-end projects so as to increase their future-proofness, flexibility to welcome changes and innovation, product quality, and developer experience.

Front-end Engineering have similar goals but goes about solving them with concerns related to [Code Quality](https://www.perforce.com/blog/sca/what-code-quality-overview-how-improve-code-quality), [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), and [System Design](http://sce.uhcl.edu/whiteta/sdp/architectureDesignAndDetailedDesign.html). On the other hand, Front-end Architecture, besides making sure that proper Front-end Engineering is conducted, it includes higher level concerns such as strategic evaluation of the growth-direction of applications, internal software ecosystem, workforce availability, compatibility requirements with existing and coming systems, etc, in order to provide strategic directives to front-end shops.

Without Front-end Architecture, problems are addressed from an techincal point-of-view, with optimum engineering solutions, which not necessarily make front-end products future-proof or aligned with internal and external forces. In fact, thoughtful architectural plans is the best way to prevent developers from over-engineering the code, while still keeping it flexible and open to coming changes.

As the Software Architecture saying goes: "Do you think good architecture is expensive? Try bad architecture". In fact, architectural work will always happen, whether it is done intentionally (and mindfully) or not. 

Many people trying to avoid architectural work, often in the name of increasing development speed, claim to be enabling an "organic growth". However, organic growth only works in the presence of a strong blueprint (the DNA), which brings order to that process. Without that guidance, the fate is chaos.

The goal of architectural plans isn't to limit developers' ability to adjust to change requests, as a rigit box. On the contraire, stragically created plans managed by professional architects, will be the very thing that will facilitate the absortion of coming changes. If software products must be flexible, so should the plans that bring healthy order to its growth.

Architecture, in terms of software, is related to the things that are expensive to change ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)). That is not to say that Engineering issues could never have expensive consequences, because they can. However, architecture itself will not aim to micromange the development process, but provide directives on decisions that are quite costly to be modified once implemented.

## Examples of front-end architectural concerns:

- Actively monitor the front-end panorama - both internally and externally to the organization

- Conduct Proofs of Concept and research of new technologies

- Align front-end efforts within the organization

- Identify opportunities for reusability

- Promote and capture innovation ideas among developers

- Identify opportunities for embracing new technologies

- Identify the directions of growth of applications

- Create or assist in the creation of the [Software Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design) of new applications

- Prepare system for smooth transition into new technologies

- Balance expectations of multiple stakeholders and find technical solutions that meet quality attributes (trade offs)

- Setup efficient and pleasant dev enviroments

- Set standards and best practices for front-end development teams

- Define realistic and sustainable protocols and processes for documentation and testing

- Find efficient ways to communicate architectural decisions to multiple types of stakeholders

- Study the past, present, and future of web technologies. Monitor the state of web technologies and preformed educated predictions

- Identify preemptively challenges and road blocks that new technologies (or new versions) will bring, and find best solutions for them

- Synchronize technologies, standards, and efforts across multiple teams in the organization

- Provide training for developers on new technologies

- Organize the workflow as to maximize productivity (shield developers from unwanted / unecessary meetings, recommend purchase of adequate tools, etc)

- Work with managers to find ways to promote retention of developers (employee retention programs)

- Find ways to improve development experience

- Help to facilitate deployment processes

- Help reduce pro-active over-engineering

- Help apply efforts on more strategic points

- Help non-technical stakeholders to learn all of their technical options, including new technologies and their pros and cons

- Help identify and translate business needs and expectations into technical directives, making sure that the technical aspects will continuously support and favor them

- Scaffold new complex applications (system design), setting developers in the right direction

- Coordinate think tanks and brain trusts on front-end matters

- Help bring balance to battles between UX vs. Developers, so that UX teams are neither always pushed back nor always imposing
